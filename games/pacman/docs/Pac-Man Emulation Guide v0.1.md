# Pac-Man Emulation Guide v0.1, Oct 2008

This document is a reference for the Pac-Man video game arcade hardware, mainly written to document
my findings as I create a Pac-Man emulator for learning purposes.

The information was gathered from the Internet and my own investigations and was merged and edited
into this document. There are various red TODOs left in the document where I hope to add or clarify
material.

This was written by Chris Lomont in Oct 2008. If you have comments or fixes then email me at (my first
name) at lomont.org. Also check out my website [http://www.lomont.org.](http://www.lomont.org.)

To start, Figure 1 shows a Pac-Man ‚Äúattract‚Äù screen and the start of a level.

## Introduction

Throughout this document decimal numbers appear as usual, and hexadecimal numbers are suffixed
with an ‚Äòh‚Äô. For example 1K is 1024 bytes = 400h bytes.

Pac-Man hardware is at the highest level:

```
ÔÇ∑ Main CPU : Z80A at 3.072 MHZ
ÔÇ∑ ROM: 16K of ROM in four 4K chips
ÔÇ∑ RAM: almost 2K of working RAM
ÔÇ∑ Video:
o 2K of RAM as follows
ÔÇß 1K holds tile information.
ÔÇß 1K holds per tile palette indices.
o The visible screen is 28x36 tiles.
o Each tile is an 8x8 pixel 4-color image from 16 possible colors.
o Video resolution is thus 224x288 pixels.
o Eight 16x16 pixel hardware sprites, each with a 4-color palette from 16 possible colors.
o 60 .61 frames per second (60.61fps).
ÔÇ∑ Sound Chip : Custom monophonic 3 - voice 4 - bit Wave Sound Generator
```
## Z

The heart of the Pac-Man arcade machine is the 8-bit Z80 Central Processing Unit (CPU). It was released
in July 1976, borrowing ideas from the Intel 8080. In fact it was designed to be binary compatible with
the 8080.

The Pac-Man Z80 runs at 3.072 MHZ.

One important feature is that it addresses 16 bits of memory, so all Pac-Man addresses must lie in the
range 0-65535 (0000h-FFFFh). Pac-Man actually uses less than half of this.

The Z80 also supports three interrupt modes, although the game only uses one, the so-called ‚Äúmode 2‚Äù
set via the Z80 instruction ‚ÄúIM 2.‚Äù An emulator must support port 0 in hardware, which is used to store a
byte (used to form an address for an interrupt vector) which must be returned when triggering an
interrupt. See the section on interrupts.

## Memory Map

All hardware is memory-mapped, that is, can be accessed by reading and writing memory addresses
from the CPU.


```
The game ROM uses the lowest 16K of memory, followed by 2K of video memory for tile selection and
per tile palettes (1K each), and then a little less than 2K of general purpose RAM. This is followed at
address 5000h with 256 bytes of memory-mapped hardware devices such as counters, sound hardware,
and joystick switches.

## ROMs

Pac-Man hardware needs various Read-Only-Memory chips to function. These hold program code, color
and palette definitions, sprite and tile images, and sound waveforms. There are various sets from
different manufacturers and countries.

Table 2 lists the ten ROMs needed to run Pac-Man. The filenames are from MAME^1 and come from the
physical board description. These are for the Midway^2 1980 version of Pac-Man.

### Obtaining ROMs

These ROM sets can be found on the internet and in commercial emulators such as _Microsoft Arcade
Pocket Pack_. Since they are copyrighted by the original owners, you should obtain a legal copy from an
emulator or purchase a real Pac-Man machine from EBay! You also could purchase a legal emulator,
such as the one mentioned, and strip out the ROMs.

### Code ROMs

The four code ROMs are unencrypted binary Z80 code. Disassembled versions are on the web, although
they are poorly commented. TODO ‚Äì finish commenting disassembly and post?

### Color ROM

Colors are defined in a 32-entry palette ROM (82s123.7f) where each 8-bit entry stores a 3-bit value for
each of red and green and a 2-bit value for blue. The hardware maps these values through resistors of
value 1000s ohm, 470 ohms, and 220 ohms, dropping the 1000 ohm resistor for blue^4. Thus Pac-Man
hardware can use 32 colors, however the ROM (and hence the game) only contains 16 colors in the
lower 16 bytes; the upper 16 bytes are zeros for all black.

(^2) TODO ‚Äì more ROMsets?
(^3) TODO ‚Äì CRC type?
(^4) I think this is correct. TODO ‚Äì check this.


Each color entry corresponds to color intensity on the output hardware. For a fixed voltage V, current
(giving intensity) is proportional to 1/Resistance. The maximum current is then

```
ùëâ
220 +
```
```
ùëâ
470 +
```
```
ùëâ
1000 =
```
```
3967 ùëâ
517000
```
The highest intensity, 3967, is scaled to the highest color-channel value FFh. Noting

```
1
220 =
```
```
2350
517000
1
470 =
```
```
1100
517000
1
1000 =
```
```
517
517000
```
then the 220 ohm resistor (and the corresponding bit) gives a weight of 2350 * FFh/3967 =97h. Similarly
47 0 ohm gives 47h and 1000 gives 21h.

Using this to compute the output RGB values gives the weights 97h, 47h, and 21h. Since the blue
channel only has 2 bits with 470 and 220 ohm resistors, similar calculations give weights 51h and AEh
respectively. This is summarized in Table 3.

#### Bit Color Connected to resistor Weight

0 Red (Least amount) 1000 ohm 21h
1 Red 470 ohm 47h
2 Red (Most amount) 220 ohm 97h
3 Green (Least amount) 1000 ohm 21h
4 Green 470 ohm 47h
5 Green (Most amount) 220 ohm 97h
6 Blue 470 ohm 51h
7 Blue 220 ohm AEh
**Table 3 ‚Äì Color ROM bits**

The first byte in the ROM is color 0 , the second byte is color 2, etc. Although the ROM has space for 32
colors, only the first 16 are used, with the remaining 16 bytes being 0 which is black. The first 16 colors
are shown in Figure 2 , and the corresponding RGB values (0-255 range) are

```
{ 0 , 0 , 0 },{ 255 , 0 , 0 },{ 222 , 151 , 81 },{ 255 , 184 , 255 },{ 0 , 0 , 0 },{ 0 , 255 , 255 }, 71 , 184 , 255 , 255 , 184 , 81
```
```
0 , 0 , 0 , 255 , 255 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 33 , 33 , 255 , 0 , 255 , 0 ,{ 71 , 184 , 174 },{ 255 , 184 , 174 },{ 222 , 222 , 255 }
```
```
Figure 2 ‚Äì Pac-Man Colors
```

For some reason four of the entries are black^5.

### Palette ROM

Each palette in the 256 byte palette ROM (82s126.4a) consists of 4 bytes, so this ROM stores 64
palettes. The first four bytes are palette 0, the next four bytes are palette 1, etc. The values in each entry
reference a color from the color ROM. Since the color ROM only uses 16 colors, each byte only uses the
lower 4 bits to store a number 0-15. Finally, only the first 32 palettes are not completely black, and of
these several are all black.

Figure 3 shows the first 32 palettes, left to right, one palette per column. Palette color 0 is the bottom
and palette color 3 is the top. By inspection the ghost palettes are 1, 3, 5, and 7.

```
Figure 3 ‚Äì Pac-Man Palettes
```
### Tile (Character) ROM

The background, scores, bonus items, and dots are drawn on a static background using images from the
4096 byte tile ROM (pacman.5e). Figure 4 shows the images decoded from the tile ROM using palette 1.

Each tile is an 8x8 pixel image, stored as 2 bits per pixel, thus using 16 bytes per tile. The 4096 byte ROM
thus holds 256 tiles, including a character font and two sets of differently spaced digits.

Drawing a tile uses a byte in Tile RAM to select one of the 256 four-color tiles to display, and also uses a
byte in the Palette RAM to select the palette used to color the tile.

Decoding images from the Tile ROM is slightly messy. Each byte stores 4 pixels, but they are stored in
bitplanes. Thus the least significant bit of each pixel is stored in the lower four bits of the byte, and the
most significant bit of each pixel is stored in the higher 4 bits of the byte (see Table 4 ).

#### Bit Usage

```
0 Bit 0 of pixel #
1 Bit 0 of pixel #
2 Bit 0 of pixel #
3 Bit 0 of pixel #
4 Bit 1 of pixel #
5 Bit 1 of pixel #
6 Bit 1 of pixel #
7 Bit 1 of pixel #
Table 4 ‚Äì Tile ROM byte layout
```

TODO ‚Äì figure out why.


The resulting 4 pixels from each byte are vertical strips. The first 8 bytes draw the lower half of the tile,
left to right, top to bottom. The last 8 bytes defining the tile draw the top half of the tile^6. The images
are stored in columns since the Pac-Man hardware has the screen rotated 90 degrees, and reading them
in this order results in easier scanline drawing in hardware (TODO - conjecture!?).

```
Figure 4 ‚Äì Pac-Man tiles in the tile ROM
```
### Sprite ROM

The 4096 byte Sprite ROM (pacman.5f) stores 16x16 pixel sprites. Each pixel uses 2 bits, resulting in each
sprite using 64 bytes of ROM. 4096/64 = 64 sprites stored in ROM. Figure 5 shows the decoded sprites

TODO ‚Äì check this is correct.


with sprites 0-7 across the top, etc. The image is drawn using palette 1 which is black, light gray, blue,
and red.

```
Figure 5 ‚Äì Pac-Man sprite ROM
```
Decoding the sprites works similarly to decoding the tiles. Each byte represents 4 pixels in a column,
stored low bits then high bits just like the tiles. Each 8 bytes draw a strip of 8x4 pixels, just like tiles.
These 8 strips are then arranged

5 1
6 2
7 3
4 0
The complete pixel ordering is then^7

TODO ‚Äì check these orderings.

### Sound ROMs

Sound is generated by playing waveforms stored in the two 256 byte Sound ROMs (82s126.1m and
82s126.3m). The sound hardware only takes 4-bit samples, so each byte entry has the top nibble set to
0. This gives in total 512 four-bit sound samples. These are organized into 16 waveforms, each 32
samples long, and each sample value from 0-15.

Ordering them from Sound ROM1 (82s126.1m) to Sound ROM2 (82s126.3m), the waveforms are shown
in Figure 6.

```
Figure 6 ‚Äì Pac-Man Sound ROM waveforms
```
These are ordered 0-3 in the top row, left to right. The next row left to right is 4,5,6,7, etc. It seems the
last four are not used, and the previous four may also be unused^8.

## Video

##### 8

```
TODO ‚Äì check this from the disassembly.
```

The video is drawn from two components: tiles and sprites. The hardware supports

```
ÔÇ∑ 8 sprites that are 16x16 pixel images,
ÔÇ∑ a 28 wide by 3 6 tall grid of tiles, each capable holding an 8x8 pixel image.
```
Thus the effective pixel resolution is 224x2 88 (28*8 = 224, 3 6 *8=2 88 ). The tiles are used to draw a static
background, and the sprites are used to draw moving items.

### Layout

To understand how video is drawn, the mapping from memory address to screen locations is needed.
The following description works for both the 1K tile RAM 4000h-43FFh (each byte selects a tile to draw)
and the 1K palette RAM 4400h-47FFh.

The first 64 addresses draw two rows, right to left, top to bottom, along the bottom of the screen, each
row 32 tiles wide, with 4 of the tiles off-screen on both ends. Then the next 380h (896 decimal)
addresses fill in the main screen, top to bottom, right to left, using offsets from 40h to 3BFh. This gives a
28x32 tile center region. Finally the last 64 addresses in each bank draw two more 32 tile wide rows
along the top, right to left, top to bottom, again with 4 tiles off-screen. The off-screen locations could be
used to hide unused sprites, which are always on^9. The result is a 28x36 tile visible screen. With each tile
8x8 pixels, this gives the 224x288 pixel resolution.

For clarity examine Figure 7 and Figure 8 for offsets. Figure 9 shows an overlaid Pac-Man screen.

### Tiles

Each byte in Video RAM entry from 4000h-43FFh (Tile RAM) causes a tile from the Tile ROM to be
drawn. The corresponding byte in 4400h-47FFh (Palette RAM) selects a palette from the palette ROM to
apply to the tile, and this palette in turn references colors defined in the color ROM.


Each tile is an 8x8 pixel image; the resulting grid is a 28x36 grid of tiles. The first two rows, 32 bytes
each, are used to hold the fruit/credit/prize display at the screen bottom. The next 28 rows are rotated
as explained above, and contain the maze and game play area. The top two rows contain the score and
related information.

### Sprites

The Pac-Man hardware supports 8 sprites; each is a 16x16 pixel image that can be drawn at any location.
Each can be flipped in the x and/or y directions, reducing the amount of sprite images stored in ROM.
For example, the left and right facing Pac-Man images are the same sprite with a different x-flip bit set.
The cocktail mode Pac-Man games flip the screen for two-player modes by flipping sprites and
reordering tiles.

The eight hardware sprites are programmed through addresses 4FF0h-4FFFh and 5060h-506Fh, listed in
Table 5. For each of the 8 sprites, the sprite image number 0-63, x-flip, y-flip, and palette are set through
the addresses shown in Table 6.

Each sprite can thus select a different palette. Color 0 in sprite images are drawn as transparent,
allowing the background tiles to show through. Setting the X and Y locations allows the sprites to be
positioned anywhere on the screen with pixel accuracy. They‚Äôre positioned offscreen when not needed.
Sprites are displayed in reverse order; higher numbered overlapped sprites are overwritten by lower
numbered sprites.

The X and Y locations denote the upper left corner of the sprite image. The screen coordinates start on
the lower right corner of the screen. Thus, including hidden coordinates, the lowest coordinate pair
where a 16x16 sprite is completely visible is location (31,16). If drawn lower, it wraps to the top of the
screen. The sprite does not show up on the top or bottom two rows where the video is laid out
differently, as explained the section on Video Layout. Visible pixel coordinates are in Figure 10.


## Sound

The sound chip is a custom-made 3-channel Waveform Sound Generator (WSG). It can play three
simultaneous voices each with independent volume, frequency, and waveform. It is accessed using 4-bit
memory-mapped registers, whose addresses are in Table 7. The WSG runs at main CPU clock/32, i.e.,
3.072 MHz/32 = 96 kHz.

Each register disregards the top nibble in each byte. The hardware supports 3 monophonic voices, each
with 16 volume levels and an independent choice of 8 pre-defined waveforms. One voice has 20 bits of
frequency choice, while the other two have 16 bits of frequency.

At each clock and for each voice the hardware performs the following steps:

1. Add the 20-bit (or 16-bit) voice frequency to the 20-bit (or 16-bit) accumulator.
2. Use the waveform 0-7 to lookup a 32-byte sample in the Sound ROM.
3. Take the top 5 bits of the accumulator to look up a nibble 0-31 in that sample.
4. Multiply that nibble by the volume nibble 0-15.
5. Send the result to the amplifier for output.

As a result, a voice is silent if the volume is zero.

Frequencies and counters are 20-bit or 16-bit values, depending on voice, and are stored in the least
significant nibble of 5 (or 4) bytes, with the least significant nibble in the lowest address. Voices #2 and
#3 do not implement the lowest nibble, which is always 0. Thus they have slightly lower dynamic range
than voice #1, which is used in the code for TODO.

### Waveforms

As explained in the Sound ROM section, samples are stored as 32 entries of 4-bits each. They can be
selected by setting 0-7 in the appropriate voice.

### Frequency

For each voice there are 4 registers controlling the tone. Voice #1 adds a 5th register allowing very low
frequencies.

How does this convert to notes for a musical scale? Using scientific pitch notation^10 to denote middle C
as C 4 , then the first A higher in pitch is known as A440 (or as A 4 ) since it is 440 Hz. Here‚Äôs a computation
of the values to put in the frequency register to get a 440 Hz tone for Voice #1.

To play the A 4 tone (440 Hz) use sample 0, which is a pure sine tone and has one cycle per sample. If a
sample has two cycles per sample this example would need changed accordingly.

Starting with the 96 kHz accumulator rate, sample 0 produces a complete sound cycle every 32 samples.
To get 440 Hz, 440*32 = 14080 samples are needed per second. 96000 clocks per second / 14080
samples per second = 75/11 clocks per sample. Since the top 5 bits of 20 select the sample, there are 20 -
5 = 15 bits representing ‚Äúfractional‚Äù values. 2^15/(75/11) = 4806 = 12C6h.This needs stored in the
frequency of a voice to use sample 0 for a note with A 4 = 440 Hz frequency.

Thus to get the register value ùëâ for frequency ùëì using sample 0 use the formula

##### ùëâ=

##### ùëì√ó 32

##### 96000 √ó^2

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation)


Each octave is half/double the frequency of the one above/below it, so this gives counts for all octaves
of A. Since there are 12 half-steps per octave, to go one half-step higher simple multiply the value by

(^12 2). C 3 is 3 half-steps up, so has frequency 440 √ó 12 2

= 523. 251 Hz. This then corresponds to

Note that this is for the 5 register voices. For the 4 register voice round the low nibble up; this will result
in tones being slightly off.

### Volume

Per-voice volume is a straightforward value 0-15, with 0 being muted to 15 being loudest.

### Accumulator

The per-voice accumulator is used internally to select Sound ROM samples at some program defined
frequency. It is not clear if these can be read (or set?) from the code (TODO ‚Äì find out).

### Sound Enable Register

Register 50C0h is the sound enable register, enabling or disabling all voices simultaneously. Write 0 to
bit 0 of this register to disable sound and write 1 to bit 0 to enable sound.

### Code

Sound register usage can be studied from the Pac-Man ROM sound routines through disassembly (if you
know how, can read Z80, etc.). The main sound code is at addresses 2CC1h-2F54h, the interrupt portion
is in two sections at 009Dh-00D2h (VBLANK1?) and 01B9h-01BCh (VBLANK2). Sound tables are at 3B30h-
3CDDh. Details are at [http://www.vecoven.com/elec/pacman/code/pac_z80.html.](http://www.vecoven.com/elec/pacman/code/pac_z80.html.)


Some routine highlights:

The software updates the sound registers 60 times a second during the VBLANK. Each voice plays an
effect or a song.

An effect is encoded with eight bytes, and can be played on any voice.

0. Upper 3 bits are frequency shift, lower 3 bits are sample select.
1. Initial base frequency
2. Frequency increment
3. Upper bit causes reversal, lower 7 bits is duration.
4. Frequency increment added to base when repeat > 1
5. Repeat
6. Upper 4 bits denote volume adjust type, lower 4 bits is volume
7. Volume increment.

A song is a list of special bytes and tone information, and is played on voices 1 and 2 simultaneously.

A regular byte contains

```
ÔÇ∑ Upper 3 bits ‚Äì log base 2 of duration
ÔÇ∑ Lower 4 bits ‚Äì base frequency using lookup table
ÔÇ∑ Sometimes the lower 5 bits are assigned to W_DIR where the 5th bit has significance?!
```
Special song bytes include

```
ÔÇ∑ F0h followed by 2 bytes : address where song continues (jump in ROM)
ÔÇ∑ F1h followed by 1 byte : wave select
ÔÇ∑ F2h followed by one byte: frequency increment
ÔÇ∑ F3 followed by one byte: volume
ÔÇ∑ F4h followed by 1 byte : type
ÔÇ∑ FFh : end of song.
```
## Interrupts

### Interrupt Enable

Address 5000h is the interrupt enable register. Setting bit 0 to 0 disabled vertical blank (VBLANK)
interrupts, and setting bit 0 to 1 enables VBLANK interrupts.

### VBLANK

This is the vertical blank signal, which is triggered each time the electron gun scans to the bottom of the
screen while drawing an image. This happens 60.61 times a second, which is every 16.67 milliseconds. If
interrupts are enabled, the Z80 CPU is sent an interrupt signal. Depending on the interrupt mode set in
the code different actions are taken.


Triggered by the VBLANK, the Z80 refreshes the sound frequencies, volumes, and waveforms.

In order for interrupts to work Port 0 has to behave properly.

### Port 0

Port 0 from the CPU sets the interrupt vector. The code occasionally writes a byte to port 0, which has to
be returned when a VBLANK interrupt is triggered.

The Z80 in Pac-Man code runs in Interrupt mode 2 (using the Z80 opcode IM 2). The Z80 instructions LD
A,#CD; OUT (0),A for example set the interrupt address to I*256+CDh where I is the interrupt register.

## Registers

Here are various memory-mapped registers not explained elsewhere, their uses and addresses.

Most of the control lines are normally closed, that is, the bit will be 1 when the switch is not pressed.
Thus, for example, the joystick up button bit will read 1 when the joystick is not pressed up and will read
0 when pressed up. This is true for the coin slots also.

Also there are a few sets of registers where each byte in a range has the same function. They are
marked in the memory map.

### Watchdog Timer

Lots of hardware/software systems have a ‚Äúwatchdog timer,‚Äù and Pac-Man is no different. A watchdog
timer is a timer that the running software has to ‚Äúkick‚Äù within a certain time period, or the watchdog
resets the system. This is so if the software hangs, the system is restarted by the watchdog. Vernacular
is to ‚Äúkick the dog‚Äù when sending notification to the watchdog timer from software.

The watchdog timer at addresses 50C0h-50FFh (all bytes are the same function) constantly counts
upwards, resetting the machine when it reaches its limit. It counts each VLBANK on a four bit counter
(the 74LS161 at 9c on the Pac-Man board), so when it reaches 16 the carry from the counter will reset
the machine. This means the code has to kick the dog faster than about 4 times per second. Precisely it
needs reset before 16 frames of game elapse, at 60 frames per second. The Pac-Man code has relevant
instructions are scattered throughout the ROMs to kick the dog, about 3 times per frame, mostly with
zeroes, but occasionally (TODO) with a decreasing counter (TODO ‚Äì why?).

### Flip Screen

Flipped screen (write only byte at 5003h) is used in cocktail mode to flip the screen for the second
player, which _flips the tiles only_. The sprites are flipped by the game code. Bit 0 set to 0 creates a normal
screen; bit 0 set to 1 flips the screen.

### IN0/IN

The **IN0** port (read-only byte at address 5000h) is connected to the joystick and coin slots. The credit
button works like a coin slots but adds a credit without incrementing the coin counter. The **IN1** port


(read-only byte at address 5040h) is connected to the second player joystick (only on a cocktail table
version) and the start buttons.

#### Bit Description of port IN0 Description of port IN

### Dip Switches

Memory addresses 5080h-50BFh are memory mapped to a set of 8 DIP switches on the main board.
Each byte is the same value, and is read only to read hardware settings on the board. On the hardware
these are 8 small switches, with ‚ÄúOFF‚Äù setting the bit to 0, and ‚ÄúOn‚Äù setting the bit to 1.

#### Bit DIP Switch Description Values

```
0,1 Coins per game: 0=free play
1=1 coin per game
2=1 coin per 2 games
3=2 coins per game
2,3 # lives per game: 0=1 life
1=2 lives
2=3 lives
3=5 lives
4,5 Bonus score for extra life: 0=10000 points
1=15000 points
2=20000 points
3=none
6 Difficulty (jumper pad): 0 = hard
1 = normal
7 Ghost names(jumper pad): 0=alternate
1 = normal
Table 10 ‚Äì Dip Switch Settings
```
The difficulty switch changes the algorithm the ghosts use, with the effect of making less places Pac-Man
can hide. There may be other changes also (TODO ‚Äì find out?). Setting it breaks many patterns used in
gameplay. Default and alternate ghost names are in Table 11.

### Start Lamps

Pac-Man does not use start lamps accessed from registers 5004h (1 player) and 5005h (2 player).

### Coin Lockout

Coin lockout mechanisms are hardware designed to keep more coins from being added during game
play, so that software does not have to check for new coins all the time. Pac-Man does not have this
hardware, so this is unused?! The Pac-Man code must watch for coin drops.

### Coin Counters

Register 5007h triggers coin counting by triggering bit 0 from value 0 to 1.

## Miscellaneous

### Restart

The CPU starts executing at ROM address 0000h on restart.

### ROM Checksum

ROM modifications are detected using a simple checksum routine at address 3000h, shown in Figure 11.
It sums all the bytes in each of the 4K banks, and the sum of the even bytes must be 0 and the sum of
the odd bytes must be 0. The last two bytes (TODO ‚Äì right?) in each of the four ROMs are set to values
accomplishing this.


```
Figure 11 ‚Äì ROM Checksums
```
### Copy Protection

Some claim that the port 0 byte stored as explained in the Interrupt section is used for copy protection,
making it harder for bootleggers. However this is trivial to implement, and it seems more likely (without
further documentation) that this feature merely makes programming interrupts easier and more
flexible.

There is a false IM 1 handler at location 0038h which disables external interrupts (5000h), clears the coin
counter at 5007h, then infinite loops. The watchdog timer restarts the machine soon thereafter.

Incorrect implementations of the port 0 hardware will cause trouble. However port 0 behavior might be
designed to ease testing and troubleshooting of the hardware.

### Tests

Turning on the game board test switch does diagnostics, shown in Figure 12. The first image shows bad
video ram, the center shows a passed test and DIP Switch settings, and the final one shows a grid for
testing the screen image. Different sounds are played on joystick movements, start buttons, and coin
slot toggles.

### Easter Egg

#### There is an Easter Egg found in both the Midway and Namco ROMs. Hold down both player

#### start buttons and toggle the test switch to pull up the test grid. Then push the joystick 4 times up,

#### then 4 times left, then 4 times right then 4 times down. The result screen is in Figure 13.

### Gameplay

##### TODO?!


**Patterns**
Since all ghost actions are determined by Pac-Man location and actions, patterns can be devised to pass
boards. They are often named based on the bonus item, such as ‚Äúthe Cherry Pattern‚Äù and ‚Äúthe 9th Key
Pattern.‚Äù Find them on the internet.

### Bugs

**Split-Screen**
There is a bug in the fruit drawing routine, which causes board 256 to be a garbled mess (Figure 14 ) that
so far has been impassible despite enormous effort expended to conquer it. As demonstrated by Don
Hodges in his article ‚ÄúSplitting Apart the Split Screen,‚Äù it is caused by an error in the code. A counter
overflows on board 256, and the fruit-drawing routine (address 2B8Fh) trashes video memory by trying
to draw 256 fruits. This results in not enough dots on the screen for Pac-Man to eat and pass the level.
Don used a ROM disassembly to create a 9 - byte in-place fix, which allows passing the level. At first
glance it seems his fix does not alter the ghost behavior, but will require more checking.

```

```
**Ghost pass through**
A bug occasionally allows Pac-Man to pass through a non-blue ghost unharmed. Several patterns exploit
this bug, and some can be seen on YouTube. An excellent one for 9th key patterns is shown in Figure 15.
See it on YouTube at [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s82nzkZBaek&feature=related.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s82nzkZBaek&feature=related.)


```
Figure 15 ‚Äì Pac-Man passes through ghosts.
```
This bug is caused by the collision detection being done on an 8x8 grid, and when the Pac-Man enters a
ghost grid at the exact time slice the ghost enters the Pac-Man cell they will pass without contact.

**Hiding places**
Not quite a bug, there are patterns resulting in places you can leave Pac-Man and ghosts will never find
him. This is useful for breaks during marathon gaming sessions. See this YouTube pattern for an example
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9vlCsjF3zU&feature=related.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9vlCsjF3zU&feature=related.)

When the ghosts are not closely pursuing Pac-Man, he can go to the spot immediately to the right and
up from his starting location, facing upwards. The ghosts will never find him, and will continue to
wander the board.

**Up Direction**
The MAME sourcecode states there is a minor bug in the up direction of Pac-Man animation: the circle
animation is 1 pixel too low.

**Fixes**
TODO ‚Äì later ROM versions have fixed some of these items?

### ROM Sets

There are various ROM sets in the wild, and different difficulty levels. A good way to determine which
set you have is the location Pac-Man dies in the attract mode animation.

There were three chip sets in the US. Each has two modes, easy and hard (or slow and fast as some call
them). The speed can be as high as 8x factory ‚Äúslow‚Äù speeds.


The three chipsets are the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù one, the Atlantic one, and the rare Manhattan chipset. Patterns are
different on each one, and most patterns on the internet are for the original ROMs.

**Table 12 ‚Äì ROM Versions**

The Atlantic City chipset was developed to remove the hiding spot, but failed. Supposedly it allows a
player to ‚Äúkill‚Äù a ghost by eating the ghost and an energizer at the same, resulting in that ghost not
coming back for the rest of that level.

## Algorithms

### Random numbers

TODO ‚Äì explain the pseudo random number generator (PRNG) in AI.

### Ghost Movement

Probably the most interesting algorithm is the ghost movement algorithm. This has been discussed
online, and there is disassembly of the algorithms available.

The first point is there are ‚Äúscatter‚Äù and ‚Äúgather‚Äù periods. The ghosts start a level in ‚Äúgather‚Äù mode,
trying to reach Pac-Man. After a long time, they go to scatter mode, trying to avoid Pac-Man, and each
going to a different quadrant of the board. Gather/scatter repeats a few times, is time based, and
eventually ghosts return only to gather mode only.

The rough gather algorithms are:

**Red** : The only input is Pac-Man's location. Red attempts to reduce the distance between himself and
Pac-Man, by turning in the direction that will immediately reduce the greater of the horizontal or
vertical distance between himself and Pac-Man.

**Pink** : The input is four tiles in front of Pac-Man, which is then Pinky's "target." Pinky uses the same logic
as Red to reach this location. Thus reversing on Pinky will chase him away.

**Blue** : the inputs are the square two tiles in front of Pac-Man and the location of the Red ghost. Draw a
line from the Red ghost to the spot 2 tiles in front of Pac-Man, and extend that line twice as far in the
same direction. Blue‚Äôs target is that spot. Figure 16 shows Blue AI code disassembled.

**Orange** : Orange behaves differently is he is "near" (within 8 tiles of Pac-Man) or "far" (farther away than
8 tiles). ‚ÄúFar‚Äù mode duplicates Red‚Äôs logic. ‚ÄúNear‚Äù mode causes Orange to head to his corner of the


maze, lower left, where he circles. So if Pac-Man is in the lower left area quadrant, Orange will hassle
Pac-Man.

**Edible ghost** : The edible ghost uses a pseudo random number generator (PRNG) that creates a random
address from 0000h to 1FFFh, which is used to look up a byte, reading the last bits. These bits determine
the direction choices. This PRNG is reset at each level or life.

A small change to the code, such as never resetting this PRNG, would make Pac-Man level patterns
impossible, since every game would start with an unknown state.

```

```
### Notes

```
ÔÇ∑ Each dot resides in its own tile so 1 tile equals the distance from one dot to the next.
ÔÇ∑ Pac-Man can turn corners faster than the ghosts can, so turning corners helps escape ghosts.
ÔÇ∑ Eating dots slows Pac-Man a little bit, so eating dots allows ghosts to catch up.
ÔÇ∑ The ghosts never go upwards into the two passages immediately above the pen.
```
